            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently
                takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may
                be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
                A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education
                with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">The State of Government Education</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In some cases, this vision has become a reality. The state of Rajasthan, for example, has reduced the number of its schools by around 20% by merging several small-scale schools to create one well-resourced school for each Gram Panchayat (village).
                These integrated schools extend from Grade 1-10/12, offering older pupils easier access to senior secondary education. But this is the exception rather than the rule. Now, of course, we recognise that India has made significant strides
                in children's education over the last two decades. The launch of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All) in 2001 was a defining policy move. So was the opening of new schools across the country under the Right to Education, along with
                benefits such as midday meal schemes, free uniforms and textbooks, and vastly improved infrastructure. These reforms have ensured ~97% Grade 1 enrolment nationwide. Alongside all this progress, though, a major problem has arisen: there
                are just too many schools, particularly small-scale ones. There's one school to every square kilometre, as specified by legislation. But the result is that India now has about 420,000 government schools with fewer than 50 students, of
                which 110,000 schools have less than 20 pupils. There are usually only one or two teachers in these schools, for all of Classes 1-5 (for primary schools) / 6-8 (for middle schools). The outcome is that India has around 280 million students
                studying in 1.5 million schools. Compare that with China, which has 220 million students in only 266,000 schools.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A meticulous process is required for this initiative to succeed. Within each area, we should identify several schools that are suitable for consolidation before selecting a host school based on its distance from the others and its capacity
                to house the desired number of pupils. Then we have to arrange efficient transport to ensure that all children have easy access. Block-level committees need to lead the implementation effort and ensure all stakeholders are aligned. Detailed
                consolidation guidelines need to be issued, and grievance redressal committees set up to deal with any issues that come up. Implementation needs to be closely monitored to ensure the benefits of consolidation are actually realised. In
                the past 15 years, we've taken schools to children - now we need to take our children to the schools.
